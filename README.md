 ### Matrices
 ```matrices.py```
 
 The input can be easily changed to solve for different parameters
 
 - Gauss with total pivoting
 
 - Determining invertibility of matrix
 
 - Gauss method for determining invertibility of matrix 
 
 - LU factorization with partial pivoting
 
 - Cholesky factorization
